          On <span className="font-semibold">June 4, 2010</span>, SpaceX
          achieved a groundbreaking milestone by launching the Dragon
          spacecraft aboard the Falcon 9 rocket. This mission made SpaceX the
          first private company to successfully design, launch, orbit, and
          recover a spacecraft.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200 mb-4">
          The Dragon capsuleâ€™s safe return demonstrated SpaceXâ€™s capability to
          build spacecraft that could eventually support cargo and crew
          missions to the International Space Station. This historic achievement
          marked the beginning of Dragonâ€™s legacy as a vital part of NASAâ€™s
          Commercial Resupply Services program.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base italic text-gray-300">
          This mission proved that privately developed spacecraft could achieve
          feats once reserved for government agencies, setting the stage for a
          new era in space exploration.
